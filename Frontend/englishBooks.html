      <h1>"The Great Gatsby"</h1>
      <h2>F. Scott Fitzgerald</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Tragedy</h4>
      <p>The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel by American writer F. Scott Fitzgerald. Set in the Jazz Age on Long Island, the novel depicts narrator Nick Carraway's interactions with mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and Gatsby's obsession to reunite with his former lover, Daisy Buchanan. The novel was inspired by a youthful romance Fitzgerald had with a socialite, and by parties he attended on Long Island's North Shore in 1922. Following a move to the French Riviera, he completed a rough draft in 1924. After submitting the draft to editor Maxwell Perkins, the editor persuaded Fitzgerald to revise the work over the following winter. Despite being happy with the content of the text after revision, Fitzgerald was ambivalent about the book's title and considered a variety of alternatives. The final title that he was documented to have desired was Under the Red, White, and Blue. Fitzgerald was, however, happy with painter Francis Cugat's final cover design.</p>

      <h1>"The Little Prince"</h1>
      <h2>Antoine de Saint-Exupery</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Classics</h4>
      <p>The Little Prince is a classic tale of equal appeal to children and adults. On one level it is the story of an airman's discovery, in the desert, of a small boy from another planet - the Little Prince of the title - and his stories of intergalactic travel, while on the other hand it is a thought-provoking allegory of the human condition.Antoine de Saint-Exupéry first published The Little Prince in 1943, only a year before his Lockheed P-38 vanished over the Mediterranean during a reconnaissance mission. More than a half century later, this fable of love and loneliness has lost none of its power. The narrator is a downed pilot in the Sahara Desert, frantically trying to repair his wrecked plane. His efforts are interrupted one day by the apparition of a little, well, prince, who asks him to draw a sheep. The Little Prince describes his journey from planet to planet, each tiny world populated by a single adult. It's a wonderfully inventive sequence, which evokes not only the great fairy tales but also such monuments of postmodern whimsy as Italo Calvino's Invisible Cities. And despite his tone of gentle bemusement, Saint-Exupéry pulls off some fine satiric touches, too.</p>

      <h1>"Anne Frank: The Diary of a Young Girl"</h1>
      <h2>Anne Frank</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Nonfiction</h4>
      <p>A beloved classic since its initial publication in 1947, this vivid, insightful journal is a fitting memorial to the gifted Jewish teenager who died at Bergen-Belsen, Germany, in 1945. Born in 1929, Anne Frank received a blank diary on her 13th birthday, just weeks before she and her family went into hiding in Nazi-occupied Amsterdam. Her marvelously detailed, engagingly personal entries chronicle 25 trying months of claustrophobic, quarrelsome intimacy with her parents, sister, a second family, and a middle-aged dentist who has little tolerance for Anne's vivacity. The diary's universal appeal stems from its riveting blend of the grubby particulars of life during wartime (scant, bad food; shabby, outgrown clothes that can't be replaced; constant fear of discovery) and candid discussion of emotions familiar to every adolescent (everyone criticizes me, no one sees my real nature, when will I be loved?). Yet Frank was no ordinary teen: the later entries reveal a sense of compassion and a spiritual depth remarkable in a girl barely 15. Her death epitomizes the madness of the Holocaust, but for the millions who meet Anne through her diary, it is also a very individual loss. </p>

      <h1>"Romeo and Juliet"</h1>
      <h2>William Shakespeare</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Tragedy</h4>
      <p>Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare  about two young star-crossed lovers whose deaths ultimately reconcile their feuding families. It was among Shakespeare's most popular plays during his lifetime and along with Hamlet, is one of his most frequently performed plays. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare creates a violent world, in which two young people fall in love. It is not simply that their families disapprove; the Montagues and the Capulets are engaged in a blood feud. In this death-filled setting, the movement from love at first sight to the lovers’ final union in death seems almost inevitable. And yet, this play set in an extraordinary world has become the quintessential story of young love. In part because of its exquisite language, it is easy to respond as if it were about all young lovers. </p>

      <h1>"A Princess of Mars"</h1>
      <h2>Edgar Rice Burroughs</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Science-Fantasy</h4>
      <p>A Princess of Mars is the first of eleven thrilling novels that comprise Edgar Rice Burroughs' most exciting saga, known as The Martian Series. It's the beginning of an incredible odyssey in which John Carter, a gentleman from Virginia and a Civil War veteran, unexpectedly finds himself on to the red planet, scene of continuing combat among rival tribes. Full of swordplay and daring feats, the novel is considered a classic example of 20th-century pulp fiction. It is also a seminal instance of the planetary romance, a subgenre of science fantasy that became highly popular in the decades following its publication. Its early chapters also contain elements of the Western. The story is set on Mars, imagined as a dying planet with a harsh desert environment. This vision of Mars was based on the work of the astronomer Percival Lowell, whose ideas were widely popularized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.</p>

      <p>March 14, 2009 Aiken Somerset looked around, blinking away the rain from his eyes. There were red and blue lights flashing through the trees in the direction of the street, and he hoped that no one he knew needed the ambulance. He craned his neck to look at the familiar specimen of fagus grandifolia, smiling at the sight of buds forming along the outermost twigs. The rain may have been close to freezing, but his tree knew that spring was just around the corner. He looked down again, and his smile faded. It had been the first time he’d ever received anything from the hole in the enormous beech tree’s trunk. Before, he had only ever deposited gifts.</p>

      <h4>Genre: Detective fiction</h4>
      <p>In general the stories in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes identify, and try to correct, social injustices. Holmes is portrayed as offering a new, fairer sense of justice. The stories were well received, and boosted the subscriptions figures of The Strand Magazine, prompting Doyle to be able to demand more money for his next set of stories. The first story, "A Scandal in Bohemia", includes the character of Irene Adler, who, despite being featured only within this one story by Doyle, is a prominent character in modern Sherlock Holmes adaptations, generally as a love interest for Holmes. Doyle included four of the twelve stories from this collection in his twelve favourite Sherlock Holmes stories, picking "The Adventure of the Speckled Band" as his overall favourite.</p>

      <h1>"Robinson Crusoe"</h1>
      <h2>Daniel Defoe</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Adventure novel</h4>
      <p>Epistolary, confessional, and didactic in form, the book is presented as an autobiography of the title character (whose birth name is Robinson Kreutznaer) – a castaway who spends 28 years on a remote tropical desert island near the coasts of Venezuela and Trinidad, encountering cannibals, captives, and mutineers, before ultimately being rescued. The story has been thought to be based on the life of Alexander Selkirk, a Scottish castaway who lived for four years on a Pacific island called "Más a Tierra", now part of Chile, which was renamed Robinson Crusoe Island in 1966. Despite its simple narrative style, Robinson Crusoe was well received in the literary world and is often credited as marking the beginning of realistic fiction as a literary genre. It is generally seen as a contender for the first English novel.</p>

      <h1>"The Woman in White"</h1>
      <h2>Wilkie Collins</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Mystery novel</h4>
      <p>The Woman in White is one of the earliest examples of detective fiction. Throughout his quest for the truth, Walter hires a number of private detectives and eventually mimics their methodology, with Collins' legal know-how lending realism to the plot line. Wilkie Collins was strongly motivated to author her novel by the unequal situation men and women found themselves: at the time, the law overtly deferred to men in matters of inheritance and estate. Published in 1859, we are immediately intrigued by the narrative - a young and genial tutor of arts, Walter Hartright, encounters a woman dressed head to toe in white who is lost in the streets of London. After reporting her to the authorities Walter is informed that the lady was an escapee from a mental asylum.</p>

      <h1>"Sense and Sensibility"</h1>
      <h2>Jane Austen</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Romance novel</h4>
      <p>Sense and Sensibility is centered around the romantic adventures of the Dashwood sisters after they are cast out from the family home after the death of their father. The sensible and reserved eldest sister, Elinor, is the “sense” half of the novel’s title, while the younger and more emotionally expressive Marianne is the “sensibility” half. The tensions and contrasts between these characters form the dramatic arch and moral focus on the story. It is because of these remarkably well-drawn and realistic characters that Sense and Sensibility, originally published in 1811, is still so widely read and beloved today and has been the subject of multiple successful TV and movie adaptations.</p>

      <h1>"The Freedom of Life"</h1>
      <h2>Annie Payson Call</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Health</h4>
      <p>The Freedom of Life is a classic self-help/self-improvment book by Annie Payson Call that provides a wide variety of tips for living a more healhy and productive life and inlcudes the following excerpt: INTERIOR freedom rests upon the principle of non-resistance to all the things which seem evil or painful to our natural love of self. But non-resistance alone can accomplish nothing good unless, behind it, there is a strong love for righteousness and truth. By refusing to resist the ill will of others, or the stress of circumstances, for the sake of greater usefulness and a clearer point of view, we deepen our conviction of righteousness as the fundamental law of fife, and broaden our horizon so as to appreciate varying and opposite points of view. The only non-resistance that brings this power is the kind which yields mere personal and selfish considerations for the sake of principles. Selfish and weak yielding must always do harm.</p>

      <h2>Harry D. Kitson</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Psychology</h4>
      <p>Educational leaders are seeing with increasing clearness the necessity of teaching students not only the subject-matter of study but also methods of study. The recognition of this condition is taking the form of the movement toward ''supervised study,'' which attempts to acquaint the student with principles of economy and directness in using his mind. It is generally agreed that there are certain ''tricks'' which make for mental efficiency, consisting of methods of apperceiving facts, methods of review, devices for arranging work. Some are the fruits of psychological experimentation; others are derived from experience. Many of them can be imparted by instruction, and it is for the purpose of systematizing these and making them available for students that this book is prepared.</p>

      <p>Suelette Dreyfus and embattled Wikileaks founder, Julian Assange, tell the compelling true story of the computer underground and the bizarre lives and crimes of an elite group of young hackers who, in the 1980s and 1990s, took on the forces of the establishment. Using home computers, they conquered some of the world’s biggest and most powerful organisations, including the US military. By day, sat in suburban school classrooms. By night they were knee-deep in NASA networks. Brilliant and obsessed, many of them found themselves addicted to hacking. Some descended into drug addiction and madness. Others were convicted and served time in gaol before slowly piecing their lives back together. From the inside, Dreyfus and Assange reveal this shadowy world of hidden identities and secret information. </p>

This profound compilation explores topics such as nature, mysticism, mortality, transcendentalism, and democracy. Inspired by personal experiences and observations, Whitman spent almost four decades piecing together the complete work, sharing societal ideals and epiphanies about life that still resonate with readers today. This sturdy leather-bound edition of the complete Leaves of Grass also includes Whitman’s preface to the original 1855 edition, in which he expounds on his personal philosophy of writing poetry.</p>

      <h1>"Jacob's Room"</h1>
      <h2>Virginia Woolf</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Fiction</h4>
      <p>Jacob's Room is the third novel by Virginia Woolf. The novel centres, in a very ambiguous way, around the life story of the protagonist Jacob Flanders and is presented almost entirely through the impressions other characters have of Jacob. Thus, although it could be said that the book is primarily a character study and has little in the way of plot or background, the narrative is constructed with a void in place of the central character if, indeed, the novel can be said to have a 'protagonist' in conventional terms. Motifs of emptiness and absence haunt the novel and establish its elegiac feel. Jacob is described to us, but in such indirect terms that it would seem better to view him as an amalgam of the different perceptions of the characters and narrator. He does not exist as a concrete reality, but rather as a collection of memories and sensations. </p>

      <h2>W. S. Gilbert</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Poetry</h4>
      <p>The Bab Ballads is a collection of light verses by W. S. Gilbert, illustrated with his own comic drawings. The book takes its title from Gilbert's childhood nickname. He later began to sign his illustrations "Bab". Gilbert wrote the "ballads" collected in the book before he became famous for his comic opera librettos with Arthur Sullivan. In writing these verses Gilbert developed his "topsy-turvy" style in which the humour is derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd. The ballads also reveal Gilbert's cynical and satirical approach to humour. They became famous on their own, as well as being a source for plot elements, characters and songs that Gilbert recycled in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas. They were read aloud at private dinner-parties, at public banquets and even in the House of Lords. The ballads have been much published, and some have been recorded or otherwise adapted.</p>

The subject matter of these poems deals with themes relating to decadence and eroticism. The author and the publisher were prosecuted under the regime of the Second Empire as an an insult to public decency. As a consequence of this prosecution, Baudelaire was fined 300 francs. Six poems from the work were suppressed and the ban on their publication was not lifted in France until 1949. Upon reading "The Swan" Victor Hugo announced that Baudelaire had created a new shudder, a new thrill in literature.</p>

      <h2>Torquato Tasso</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Romance</h4>
      <p>Jerusalem Delivered, also known as The Liberation of Jerusalem is an epic poem by the Italian poet Torquato Tasso, first published in 1581, that tells a largely mythified version of the First Crusade in which Christian knights, led by Godfrey of Bouillon, battle Muslims in order to take Jerusalem. Tasso began work on the poem in the mid-1560s. Originally, it bore the title Il Goffredo. It was completed in April, 1575 and that summer the poet read his work to Duke Alfonso of Ferrara and Lucrezia, Duchess of Urbino. Tasso's choice of subject matter, an actual historic conflict between Christians and Muslims (albeit with fantastical elements added), had a historical grounding and created compositional implications (the narrative subject matter had a fixed endpoint and could not be endlessly spun out in multiple volumes) that are lacking in other Renaissance epics. Like other works of the period that portray conflicts between Christians and Muslims, this subject matter had a topical resonance to readers of the period when the Ottoman Empire was advancing through Eastern Europe.</p>

      <h4>Genre: Adventure</h4>
      <p>"A capital story of the sea; indeed in our opinion the author is superior in some respects as a marine novelist to the better known Mr. Clarke Russell."--The Times.This story details the adventures of a lad who was found in his infancy on board a wreck, and is adopted by, and brought up as, a fisherman. By a deed of true gallantry his whole destiny is changed, and, going to sea, he forms one of a party who, after being burned out of their ship in the South Pacific, and experiencing great hardship and suffering in their boats, are picked up by a pirate brig and taken to the "Pirate Island." After many thrilling adventures, they ultimately succeed in effecting their escape. The story depicts both the Christian and the manly virtues in such colours as will cause them to be admired—and therefore imitated. There is not a single objectionable expression or suggestion throughout the book; and it abounds in adventures of just the kind that are most eagerly devoured by juvenile readers.</p>

      <h4>Genre: Adventure</h4>
      <p>White Fang is a novel by American author Jack London and the name of the book's eponymous character, a wild wolfdog. The story details White Fang's journey to domestication in Yukon Territory and the Northwest Territories during the 1890s Klondike Gold Rush. It is a companion novel (and a thematic mirror) to London's best-known work, The Call of the Wild (1903), which is about a kidnapped, domesticated dog embracing his wild ancestry to survive and thrive in the wild. Much of White Fang is written from the viewpoint of the titular canine character, enabling London to explore how animals view their world and how they view humans. White Fang examines the violent world of wild animals and the equally violent world of humans. The book also explores complex themes including morality and redemption. </p>

      <h4>Genre: Fantasy</h4>
      <p>After London, or Wild England, written in 1885, was far ahead of its time. An apocalyptic novel is commonplace in the 21st century, but at the close of the 19th century it was a new concept. Jeffries was fascinated with what nature could be if left alone. His love for the English rural areas is strong in this novel. The reader can feel his anger and dread at what change may mean to the land he loves. After some sudden and unspecified catastrophe has depopulated England, the countryside reverts to nature, and the few survivors to a quasi-medieval way of life. Beginning with a loving description of nature reclaiming England -- fields becoming overrun by forest, domesticated animals running wild, roads and towns becoming overgrown, the hated London reverting to lake and poisonous swampland -- the rest of the story is an adventure set many years later in the wild landscape.</p>

      <h1>"The Invisible Man"</h1>
      <h2>H. G. Wells</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Horror</h4>
      <p>The Invisible Man is a science fiction novel by H. G. Wells.  The Invisible Man to whom the title refers is Griffin, a scientist who has devoted himself to research into optics and who invents a way to change a body's refractive index to that of air so that it neither absorbs nor reflects light. He carries out this procedure on himself and renders himself invisible, but fails in his attempt to reverse it. A practitioner of random and irresponsible violence, Griffin has become an iconic character in horror fiction. While its predecessors, The Time Machine and The Island of Doctor Moreau, were written using first-person narrators, Wells adopts a third-person objective point of view in The Invisible Man. The novel is considered influential, and helped establish Wells as the "father of science fiction". </p>

      <h1>"The Island of Doctor Moreau"</h1>
      <h2> H. G. Wells</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Science fiction</h4>
      <p>The Island of Doctor Moreau is an 1896 science fiction novel by English author H. G. Wells. The text of the novel is the narration of Edward Prendick who is a shipwrecked man rescued by a passing boat. He is left on the island home of Doctor Moreau, a mad scientist who creates human-like hybrid beings from animals via vivisection. The novel deals with a number of philosophical themes, including pain and cruelty, moral responsibility, human identity, and human interference with nature. Wells described it as "an exercise in youthful blasphemy." The Island of Doctor Moreau is a classic work of early science fiction and remains one of Wells' best-known books. The novel is the earliest depiction of the science fiction motif "uplift" in which a more advanced race intervenes in the evolution of an animal species to bring the latter to a higher level of intelligence. </p>

      <h1>"From the Earth to the Moon"</h1>
      <h2>Jules Verne</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Science fiction</h4>
      <p>It tells the story of the Baltimore Gun Club, a post-American Civil War society of weapons enthusiasts, and their attempts to build an enormous Columbiad space gun and launch three people—the Gun Club's president, his Philadelphian armor-making rival, and a French poet—in a projectile with the goal of a Moon landing. Five years later, Verne wrote a sequel called Around the Moon.The story is also notable in that Verne attempted to do some rough calculations as to the requirements for the cannon and in that, considering the comparative lack of empirical data on the subject at the time, some of his figures are remarkably accurate. However, his scenario turned out to be impractical for safe manned space travel since a much longer barrel would have been required to reach escape velocity while limiting acceleration to survivable limits for the passengers.</p>

      <h4>Genre: Fantasy</h4>
      <p>At the Earth's Core is a 1914 fantasy novel by American writer Edgar Rice Burroughs, the first in his series about the fictional "hollow earth" land of Pellucidar. The author relates how, traveling in the Sahara desert, he has encountered a remarkable vehicle and its pilot, David Innes, a man with a remarkable story to tell. David Innes is a mining heir who finances the experimental "iron mole," an excavating vehicle designed by his elderly inventor friend Abner Perry. In a test run, they discover the vehicle cannot be turned, and it burrows 500 miles into the Earth's crust, emerging into the unknown interior world of Pellucidar. In Burroughs' concept, the Earth is a hollow shell with Pellucidar as the internal surface of that shell. </p>

      <h2>William Hope Hodgson</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Horror</h4>
      <p>The Ghost Pirates is a horror novel by English writer William Hope Hodgson, first published in 1909. In it, Hodgson never describes in any remarkable details the ghosts – if this is indeed what they are, since their true nature is left ambiguous – he merely reports on their gradual commandeering of the ship. The novel is presented as the transcribed testimony of Jessop, who we ultimately discover is the only survivor of the final voyage of the Mortzestus, having been rescued from drowning by the crew of the passing Sangier. It begins with Jessop's recounting how he came to be aboard the ill-fated Mortzestus and the rumors surrounding the vessel. Jessop then begins to recount the unusual events that rapidly increase in both frequency and severity. </p>

      <h1>"Lord of the World"</h1>
      <h2>Robert Hugh Benson</h2>
      <h4>Genre: Science fiction</h4>
      <p>Lord of the World is a 1907 novel by Monsignor Robert Hugh Benson that centers upon the reign of the Anti-Christ and the End of the World. It has been called prophetic by Dale Ahlquist, Joseph Pearce, Pope Benedict XVI and Pope Francis. Robert Hugh Benson was the youngest son of Edward White Benson, Archbishop of Canterbury, and younger brother of Edward Frederic Benson. In 1895, he was ordained a priest in the Church of England by his father who was then Archbishop of Canterbury. After many years of questioning and soul-searching he was received into the Roman Catholic Church in 1903. He was ordained a Catholic priest in 1904 and named a Monsignor in 1911. This book, written in 1907, is Benson's dystopic vision of a near future world in which religion has, by and large, been rejected or simply fallen by the wayside. The Catholic Church has retreated to Italy and Ireland, while the majority of the rest of the world is either Humanistic or Pantheistic. </p>

      <h4>Genre: Historical</h4>
      <p>Cleopatra - Being an Account of the Fall and Vengeance of Harmachis by H. Rider Haggard Cleopatra: Being an Account of the Fall and Vengeance of Harmachis is a novel written by the author H. Rider Haggard, the author of King Solomon's Mines and She. The book was first printed in 1889. The story is set in the Ptolemaic era of Ancient Egyptian history. As is the case with the majority of Haggard's works, the story draws heavily upon adventure and exotic concepts.The story, told from the point of view of the Egyptian priest Harmachis, is recounted in biblical language, being in the form of papyrus scrolls found in a tomb. Haggard's portrait of Cleopatra is quite stunning, revealing her wit, her treachery, and her overwhelming presence. All of the characters are mixtures of good and evil, and evoke both sympathy and loathing. </p>
